# Review

Please do a peer code review of the diff between the current branch and the default branch. If we are already on the default branch, do a peer code review of the last 10 commits.

## Directives
- Directive 1: Make sure we are following established patterns for this code stack and best practices (i.e. not re-inventing the wheel)
- Directive 2: Make sure we are following CleanCode, SOLID, and DRY principles where they do not conflict with Directive 1
- Directive 3: Always follow existing patterns in the repository unless they violate ethical, moral, legal, or secure coding obligations.
- Directive 4: Ask clarifying questions when necessary.

## Outputs
- A markdown file called `code-review.md` outlining your findings.
