# Summarize

Drop all previous conversation context. Write for me a copy/pastable markdown snippet suitable for a github pull request description. It does not need to include files changed but should give a summary of the goal of the change.

## Directives
- Ask clarifying questions where necessary.

## Outputs
- A markdown file called `change-summary.md` outlining your findings.
